# LawTracker — Roadmap

Authoritative backlog for LawTracker, a Python tool to track when specific laws are updated. Edit in place; commit changes alongside code.

Always load the `karpathy-guidelines` skill before starting anything here.

Closed `[x]` items are archived in `COMPLETED.md` with their full post-mortem prose. Stubs below preserve the original numbering so past session summaries and commit messages still resolve.

## Last session summary

This section holds **exactly one block** — the current/most-recent session — and it MUST be short. The next agent needs a cold pickup, not a recap.

Strict rules for writing it:

1. **≤5 bullets, ≤1 sentence each where possible.** Trim ruthlessly. If a bullet needs a paragraph, the real content belongs in a design note or `COMPLETED.md`; link it.
2. **Only what is open, in-flight, or just-filed.** Do NOT restate design decisions, rationale, or commit-by-commit walkthroughs for closed items — those live in `COMPLETED.md`; the next agent can read them if needed.
3. **No standing guidance here.** Commit discipline, status-flag rituals — all of that lives in "For future agents" below. Do not duplicate.
4. **No cross-session carry-overs.** If something is still broken session-to-session, file it as a numbered ROADMAP item instead of repeating it here.
5. **Replace in place.** Do not append a new block and archive the old one below.

**2026-04-22**

- Project scaffolded: `src/lawtracker/` package, pytest, ruff, mypy, baseline deps (httpx, beautifulsoup4, pydantic). Initial commit `d2abfab` pushed to `main`.
- ROADMAP / COMPLETED / `design/` scaffolding landed this session, modeled on the kids-schedule project.
- Backlog is empty — awaiting requirements from Tom (which jurisdictions, which source types, cadence, notification surface).
- Nothing else in flight.

## For future agents

Read this file at the start of any session where Tom mentions "LawTracker", "the law tracker", "the roadmap", or asks about the next feature. The prioritization below is settled — do not re-debate it without prompting. Work items in order unless Tom explicitly says otherwise.

Session discipline:

- Invoke the `karpathy-guidelines` skill via the Skill tool at the start of every session that touches code. Reading `reference/guidelines.md` directly does not count — the skill-load step is what anchors the discipline for the rest of the session.
- Before starting a non-trivial feature, write a short design note to `design/{feature-name}.md` capturing the scope, the decisions already made, and the test fixtures needed. A fresh session should be able to pick up mid-feature from that note plus the last commit, without re-litigating choices.
- Commit at every natural boundary, not just at feature completion. Half-finished work behind a clear commit message is recoverable; a dirty worktree is not.
- Use the built-in TodoWrite tool before starting each commit, and keep it current as you work. Tom watches the todo widget to see where you are in the plan; a stale or absent list means he can't track progress. At the start of every new commit, add/refresh todos for that commit's sub-tasks and mark one `in_progress`.
- **Flip `[ ]` → `[~]` as soon as Tom approves the plan for a backlog item — before the design note, before any code.** The status flag tells the next agent what is actually in flight; flipping only at session end means a mid-session interruption leaves the item falsely marked "not started" even though a design note and half the commits exist. Record the flip in whichever commit introduces the first artifact for the item (usually the design note); if the plan is approved but no commit has landed yet, include the flip alongside the first real change so it does not need its own throwaway commit.
- End each session by updating this file — mark in-progress items, note any deviations or follow-ups — and commit the update. **Do not flip an item to `[x]` without explicit user signoff.** When the final code commit for an item lands, leave the item in `[~]`, record the SHA, and summarize what is pending manual verification. Tom pushes, tests manually, and either confirms the close (then the next session flips it to `[x]` with the SHA preserved) or returns feedback to address. Closing on your own reads as premature.
- **Update the "Last session summary" block between each commit during a multi-commit feature, not just at session end.** The block should always reflect what *just* landed and what is next, so a mid-feature handoff — mid-session or across agents — has a clean pickup point. The block is single-slot: replace in place, do not append. Older sessions' context lives in commit messages, `COMPLETED.md`, and `design/*.md`.
- **Closed items live in `COMPLETED.md`, not here.** When Tom signs off a `[~]` item, the next session moves its full prose into `COMPLETED.md` and leaves a one-line stub at the original item number in this file. Original numbers are stable — never renumber. When touching territory that overlaps a completed item, read its full entry in `COMPLETED.md` before re-deriving decisions.
- Tests live in `tests/` and (once CI is wired) run on every push + PR. A red test check blocks merge; do not mark a feature done with tests failing.
- Honor the standing order: deterministic work lives in Python modules; any agent/LLM step does only judgment and interpretation. If a feature tempts you to move mechanical work into agent-handled text, push back.

Status legend:

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress — include a note with what is done and what remains
- `[x]` done — include the commit SHA
- `[-]` descoped / on hold — full prose preserved in "Descoped / on hold" at the bottom for possible future revival

## Backlog (priority order)

*No items yet. First backlog item will be numbered `1` and filed here once Tom provides initial requirements (which laws / jurisdictions / sources to track, detection cadence, notification surface).*

## Descoped / on hold

*None yet. Items parked here are not dead — they are off the active queue but preserved in case priorities shift. Revive by moving the full prose back under "Backlog" at the original number and flipping `[-]` → `[ ]`.*
